How long would each of these operations take in Big O notation?

4.5 Printing the value of each element in an array.

- O(n)

4.6 Doubling the value of each element in an array.

- O(n)

4.7 Doubling the value of just the first element in an array.

- O(1)

4.8 Creating a multiplication table with all the elements in the array. So
if your array is [2, 3, 7, 8, 10], you first multiply every element by 2,
then multiply every element by 3, then by 7, and so on.

- O(n^2)
